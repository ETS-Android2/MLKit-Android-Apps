<h2> <a href = "https://github.com/icanerdogan/MLKit-Android-Apps/tree/master/FaceDetection"> Face Detection App </a> </h2>

<p> With ML Kit's face detection API, you can detect faces in an image, identify key facial features, and get the contours of detected faces. Note that the API detects faces, it does not recognize people. </p>

<h2>  <a href = "https://github.com/icanerdogan/MLKit-Android-Apps/tree/master/PoseDetection" > Pose Detection App</a> </h2>
<p> The ML Kit Pose Detection API is a lightweight versatile solution for app developers to detect the pose of a subject's body in real time from a continuous video or static image. A pose describes the body's position at one moment in time with a set of x,y skeletal landmark points. The landmarks correspond to different body parts such as the shoulders and hips. The relative positions of landmarks can be used to distinguish one pose from another. </p>

<h2> <a href="https://github.com/icanerdogan/MLKit-Android-Apps/tree/master/BarcodeScanner"> Barcode Scanning App </a></h2>
<p>With ML Kit's barcode scanning API, you can read data encoded using most standard barcode formats. Barcode scanning happens on the device, and doesn't require a network connection.

Barcodes are a convenient way to pass information from the real world to your app. In particular, when using 2D formats such as QR code, you can encode structured data such as contact information or WiFi network credentials. Because ML Kit can automatically recognize and parse this data, your app can respond intelligently when a user scans a barcode.  </p>

<h2> <a href="https://github.com/icanerdogan/MLKit-Android-Apps/tree/master/ImageLabeler"> Image Labeling App </a></h2>

<p>With ML Kit's image labeling APIs you can detect and extract information about entities in an image across a broad group of categories. The default image labeling model can identify general objects, places, activities, animal species, products, and more. </p>
